\section{Upper bounds for $|L(1,\chi)|$}

\begin{thm}{Theorem (2001)}

For any primitive Dirichlet character $\chi$ of conductor $q$,
we have
$$
|L(1,\chi)|\le\tfrac12\log q
+
\begin{cases}
0&\text{when $\chi$ is even (i.e. $\chi(-1)=1$),}\\
\tfrac52-\log 6&\text{when $\chi$ is odd (i.e. $\chi(-1)=-1$).}
\end{cases}
$$
\end{thm}


When the conductor $q$ is even, this may be improved.
\begin{thm}{Theorem (2001)}

For any primitive Dirichlet character $\chi$ of even conductor $q$,
we have
$$
|L(1,\chi)|\le\tfrac14\log q
+
\begin{cases}
\tfrac12\log 2&\text{when $\chi$ is even (i.e. $\chi(-1)=1$),}\\
\tfrac54-\tfrac12\log 3&\text{when $\chi$ is odd (i.e. $\chi(-1)=-1$).}
\end{cases}
$$
\end{thm}


Similar bounds or more precise bounds may be found in
\cite{Louboutin*02},
in
\cite{Ramare*02-??}
and in
\cite{Louboutin*18},

In
\cite{Platt-Eddin*13},
we find the next result.
\begin{thm}{Theorem (2013)}

For any primitive Dirichlet character $\chi$ of conductor $q$
divisible by 3,
we have
$$
|L(1,\chi)|\le\tfrac13\log q
+
\begin{cases}
0.368296&\text{when $\chi$ is even (i.e. $\chi(-1)=1$),}\\
0.838374&\text{when $\chi$ is odd (i.e. $\chi(-1)=-1$).}
\end{cases}
$$
\end{thm}

In
\cite{SaadEddin*16},
we find improvement on the $(1/2)\log q$ bound in a very special (and
difficult) case.
\begin{thm}{Theorem (2016)}

For any primitive Dirichlet even character $\chi$ of conductor $q$,
we have
$ |L(1,\chi)|\le\tfrac12\log q - 0.02012 $.
\end{thm}



The general upper bounds are improved in
\cite{Johnston-Ramare-Trudgian*23}
as follows.

\begin{thm}{Theorem (2023)}

For any quadratic primitive Dirichlet character $\chi$ of conductor
$f\ge 10^{23}$,
we have $|L(1,\chi)|\le (1/ 2) \log f$. 
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Theorem (2023)}

For any quadratic primitive Dirichlet character $\chi$ of conductor
$f\ge 5\cdot 10^{50}$,
we have $|L(1,\chi)|\le (9/ 20) \log f$. When $f$ is even, the lower
bound on $f$ may be improved to $f\ge 2\cdot 10^{49}$.
\end{thm}




\section{Lower bounds for $|L(1,\chi)|$}

\cite{Louboutin*13}
announces the following lower bound proved in
\cite{Louboutin*15}
.

\begin{thm}{Theorem (2013)}

For any non-quadratic primitive Dirichlet character $\chi$ of conductor $f$,
we have $|L(1,\chi)|\ge 1/ ( 10\log(f/\pi))$.
\end{thm}


This is improved in
\cite{Mossinghoff-Starichkova-Trudgian*22}
where we find the next bound.
\begin{thm}{Theorem (2022)}

For any non-quadratic primitive Dirichlet character $\chi$ of conductor $f$,
we have $|L(1,\chi)|\ge 1/ ( 9.69030\log(f/\pi))$.
\end{thm}
